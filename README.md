# ML-Learning
Notebooks and code for ML experiments

Just some iPython notebooks and test code for TensorFlow, Keras, and other tools

1. KERAS MNIST - Runs a simple feedforward, fully-connected NN to classify MNIST digits.  Pretty simple.
2. HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION - Simple regression models to predict house prices in CA - linear models to Decision Trees and Random forests - also grid search for hyperparameters
3. PREDICT HOUSE PRICES - NEURAL NET - Simple regression model with neural net to predict house prices in Boston in the 1970s - a small training data set so we use cross validation and focus on trying to reduce mean average error (MAE).
4. LINEAR REGRESSION - just the basics
5. POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION + GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS - getting spicy with polynomial models and Lasso regression
6. LOGISTIC AND SOFTMAX REGRESSION:  Binary and multi-class classifiers using the Iris flower dataset
