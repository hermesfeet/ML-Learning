# ML-Learning
Notebooks and code for ML experiments

Just some iPython notebooks and test code for TensorFlow, Keras, and other tools

1. KERAS MNIST - Runs a simple feedforward, fully-connected NN to classify MNIST digits.  Pretty simple.
2. HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION - Simple regression models to predict house prices in CA - linear models to Decision Trees and Random forests - also grid search for hyperparameters
